# Youtube-DL-GUI
A Youtube-DL GUI made in C#

## Current state
Although the code is perfectly stable and functional in its current state, I cannot guarantee further development other than minor bug fixes. I've moved away from Windows and I can't justify dual booting for a single app at this point. However, I've extensively tested the project before doing so.

## Current supported features
* Download queue importing/exporting
* Thumbnails
* Queue editing
* FFMpeg GUI built-in
* UI customization
and much more!
